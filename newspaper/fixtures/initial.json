        "text": "<p>A research team led by Case Western Reserve University astronomers has found a never-before seen cloud of ionized gas associated with the Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as Messier 51a, M51a and NGC 5194, an interacting grand-design spiral galaxy located in the constellation Canes Venatici, about 26 million light-years away. The discovery, reported in the Astrophysical Journal Letters (arXiv.org preprint), provides astronomers with an unexpected \u2018front row seat\u2019 to view the behavior of a supermassive black hole and associated galaxy as it consumes and \u2018recycles\u2019 hydrogen gas.</p><p>\u201cI literally looked at the image and said, \u2018What in the world is that?\u2019 What it was turned out to be a massive cloud of ionized hydrogen gas spewed from a nearby galaxy and then essentially \u2018cooked\u2019 by radiation from the galaxy\u2019s central black hole,\u201d said Professor Chris Mihos, an astronomer at the Case Western Reserve University.</p><p>\u201cWe know of a few clouds like this in distant galaxies, but not in one so close to us. This gives astronomers a great opportunity to study up close how gas is ejected from galaxies and how black holes can influence large regions of space around those galaxies.\u201d</p><p>Named the M51 Cloud, the object spans around 81,500 x 24,460 light-years in size and is located 104,370 light-years north of Whirlpool Galaxy\u2019s center.</p><p>It was discovered through deep wide-field imaging using the Burrell Schmidt Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory.</p><p>\u201cWe needed to know whether that cloud was moving at \u2018Milky Way speed\u2019 or \u2018M-51 speed\u2019,\u201d Professor Mihos said.</p><p>\u201cOnce we had taken the spectrum of the cloud, they were able to tell how fast it was moving away from us, and we immediately knew it was part of M51, not something in our own back yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe discovery\u2019s role in more clearly understanding how galaxies eject and \u2018recycle\u2019 their gas and stars will be determined in the coming years as more researchers dig into information that had been there all along \u2014 even if unseen until now,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWe need a lot more data to tell this tale fully, for sure, and this is one of the most well-studied galaxies out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we have a chance to better understand what is happening in the Whirlpool, which informs and affects how we understand everything else about how it has evolved over time.\u201d</p>",

        "text": "<p>Several species of skinks (a type of lizard) from the island of New Guinea have lime-green colored blood \u2014 which in turn results in bright green muscles, bones, tongue, and mucous membranes, according to a team of researchers from Louisiana State University and the American Museum of Natural History.</p><p>New Guinean skinks with green blood are currently grouped into the same genus, Prasinohaema, based solely on blood coloration.</p><p>The rare coloration comes from exceptionally high concentrations of biliverdin, or green bile pigment. In mammals, it\u2019s converted to the toxic bilirubin, which causes jaundice in human newborns.</p><p>Surprisingly, green-blooded lizards remain healthy with levels of green bile that are 40 times higher than the lethal concentration in humans.</p><p>\u201cIn addition to having the highest concentration of biliverdin recorded for any animal, these lizards have somehow evolved a resistance to bile pigment toxicity,\u201d said Zachary Rodriguez, a doctoral candidate at Louisiana State University.</p><p>\u201cUnderstanding the underlying physiological changes that have allowed these lizards to remain jaundice-free may translate to non-traditional approaches to specific health problems.\u201d</p><p>To investigate the evolutionary history of green blood, Rodriguez and co-authors examined 51 species of Australasian skinks, including six species with green blood, two of which are undescribed new species.</p><p>The researchers analyzed DNA from a total of 119 individuals (27 green-blooded Prasinohaema skinks and 92 closely related red-blooded lizards).</p><p>They discovered that there are four separate lineages of green-blooded lizards, and each likely shared a red-blooded ancestor.</p><p>\u201cWe were excited by the complex history of these animals and surprised by the breadth of green-blooded lineages across lizards,\u201d Rodriguez said.</p><p>Green blood likely emerged independently in various lizards, which suggests that green blood may have an adaptive value.</p><p>Slightly elevated levels of bile pigments in other animals, including insects, fish and frogs, have played potentially positive roles in these animals.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that bile pigment can act as an antioxidant scavenging free radicals as well as preventing disease during in vitro fertilization. However, the function of green bile pigment in these lizards is still uncertain.</p><p>\u201cThe green-blooded skinks of New Guinea are fascinating to me as a parasitologist because a similar liver product, bilirubin, is known to be toxic to human malaria parasites,\u201d said Professor Susan Perkins, from the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics and the Division of Invertebrate Zoology at the American Museum of Natural History.</p><p>\u201cOngoing work examines the potential effect of the green blood pigment on malaria and other parasites that infect these lizards.\u201d</p><p>The team\u2019s results were published in the May 16, 2018 issue of the journal Science Advances.</p>",

The second, called the Plague of Cyprian, struck during a period of political instability called the third-century crisis.</p><p>\u201cThe great Antonine Plague struck the Roman Empire in CE 165 and lasted at least 15 years. The high lead emissions of the Pax Romana ended exactly at that time and didn\u2019t recover until the early Middle Ages more than 500 years later,\u201d Professor Wilson said.</p>",

        "text": "<p>The proton, one of the components of atomic nuclei, is composed of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons. A team of physicists at the Department of Energy\u2019s Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility has found an extremely high outward-directed pressure from the center of the proton, and a much lower inward-directed pressure near the proton\u2019s periphery. They have also found that quarks are subjected to a pressure of 1035 pascals near the proton\u2019s center, which is approximately ten times greater than the pressure in the heart of neutron stars, the most densely packed known objects in the Universe.</p><p>\u201cThe distribution of pressure inside the proton is dictated by the strong force, the force that binds three quarks together to make a proton. Our results also shed light on the distribution of the strong force inside the proton,\u201d said Dr. Volker Burkert, lead author of the study.</p><p>\u201cWe are providing a way of visualizing the magnitude and distribution of the strong force inside the proton. This opens up an entirely new direction in nuclear and particle physics that can be explored in the future.\u201d</p><p>Once thought impossible to obtain, this measurement is the result of a clever pairing of two theoretical frameworks with existing data.</p><p>First, there are the generalized parton distributions; they allow physicists to produce a 3D image of the proton\u2019s structure as probed by the electromagnetic force.</p><p>The second are the gravitational form factors of the proton. These form factors describe what the mechanical structure of the proton would be if researchers could probe the proton via the gravitational force.</p><p>American physicist Dr. Heinz Pagels, who developed the concept of gravitational form factors in 1966, famously observed in a paper detailing them that there was \u2018very little hope of learning anything about the detailed mechanical structure of a particle, because of the extreme weakness of the gravitational interaction.\u2019</p><p>Recent theoretical work, however, has connected generalized parton distributions to the gravitational form factors, allowing the results from electromagnetic probes of protons to substitute for gravitational probes.</p><p>\u201cThis is the beauty of it. You have this map that you think you will never get. But here we are, filling it in with this electromagnetic probe,\u201d said co-author Dr. Latifa Elouadrhiri.</p><p>The electromagnetic probe consists of beams of electrons produced by the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, a DOE Office of Science User Facility.</p><p>These electrons are directed into the nuclei of atoms, where they interact electromagnetically with the quarks inside protons via a process called deeply virtual Compton scattering.</p><p>In this process, an electron enters a proton and exchanges a virtual photon with a quark, transferring energy to the quark and proton. A short time later, the proton releases this energy by emitting another photon and continues on intact. The process is analogous to the calculations Dr. Pagels performed for how it would be possible to probe the proton gravitationally via a hypothetical beam of gravitons.</p><p>Dr. Burkert, Dr. Elouadrhiri and their colleague, Dr. Francois-Xavier Girod, were able to exploit a similarity between the well-known electromagnetic and hypothetical gravitational studies to get their result.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a photon coming in and a photon coming out. And the pair of photons both are spin-1. That gives us the same information as exchanging one graviton particle with spin-2,\u201d Dr. Girod said.</p><p>\u201cSo now, one can basically do the same thing that we have done in electromagnetic processes \u2014 but relative to the gravitational form factors, which represent the mechanical structure of the proton.\u201d</p><p>The findings appear in the journal Nature.</p>",

It opens a window into the genetic origins of the people who lived there in the past and those who live there now,\u201d said study first author Dr. Mark Lipson, of Harvard Medical School.</p><p>Dr. Lipson and co-authors extracted and analyzed DNA from the remains of 18 people who lived between about 4,100 and 1,700 years ago (from the Neolithic period to the Iron Age) in what are now Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia.</p><p>With additional support from archaeological and linguistic data, the scientists identified several major waves of genetic mixture indicative of specific migration events.</p><p>They found that the first migration took place about 45,000 years ago, bringing in people who became hunter-gatherers.</p><p>Then, during the Neolithic period, around 4,500 years ago, there was a large-scale influx of people from China who introduced farming practices to Southeast Asia and mixed with the local hunter-gatherers. People today with this ancestry mix tend to speak Austroasiatic languages, leading the team to propose that the farmers who came from the north were early Austroasiatic speakers.</p><p>The study authors also found that subsequent waves of migration during the Bronze Age, again from China, arrived in Myanmar by about 3,000 years ago, in Vietnam by 2,000 years ago and in Thailand within the last 1,000 years. These movements introduced ancestry types that are today associated with speakers of different languages.</p><p>The identification of three ancestral populations echoes a pattern first uncovered in ancient DNA studies of Europeans, but with at least one major difference: much of the ancestral diversity in Europe has faded over time as populations mingled, while Southeast Asian populations have retained far more variation.</p><p>\u201cPeople who are nearly direct descendants of each of the three source populations are still living in the region today, including people with significant hunter-gatherer ancestry who live in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Andaman Islands,\u201d said senior author Professor David Reich, of Harvard Medical School and the University of Vienna.</p><p>\u201cWhereas in Europe, no one living today has more than a small fraction of ancestry from the European hunter-gatherers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe high diversity of Southeast Asia today can be partly explained by the fact that farmers arrived much more recently than in Europe, leaving less time for populations to mix and genetic variation to even out,\u201d he added.</p><p>Also unexpected were the linguistic implications raised by analyses of the ancestry of people in western Indonesia.</p><p>\u201cThe evidence suggests that the first farmers of western Indonesia spoke Austroasiatic languages rather than the Austronesian languages spoken there today. Thus, Austronesian languages were probably later arrivals,\u201d Professor Reich said.</p><p>\u201cAdditional samples from western Indonesia before and after 4,000 years ago should settle the question.\u201d</p>",

        "text": "<p>Humans are known to have one functioning and three non-functioning chitinase genes \u2014 those that make an enzyme that digests the insect exoskeletal chitin. According to a new analysis of mammalian genomes, nearly all placental mammals have one of five different chitinase genes, though not all are functioning and some fragmentary; this suggests that the common ancestor of all placental mammals, living with dinosaurs until 66 million years ago, was an insectivore (insect eater). The study was published in the journal Science Advances.</p><p>Many bacteria have genes that produce an enzyme that breaks down insects\u2019 hard, outer shells, which are composed of a tough carbohydrate called chitin.</p><p>It\u2019s not surprising that humans and mice have a chitinase gene, since many humans today include insects in their diets, as do mice.</p><p>But humans actually have remnants of three other chitinase genes in their genome, though none of them are functional.</p><p>Dr. Christopher Emerling from the University of California, Berkeley, and the Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, and co-authors showed that these gene remnants in humans aren\u2019t unique to our species or primates, but instead can be traced to the ancestral placental mammals.</p><p>\u201cWe are looking at genomes and they are telling the same story as the fossils: that we think these animals were insectivorous and then dinosaurs went extinct,\u201d Dr. Emerling said.</p><p>\u201cAfter the demise of these large carnivorous and herbivorous reptiles, mammals started changing their diets.\u201d</p><p>The researchers found five different chitinase enzyme genes by looking through the genomes of 107 species of placental mammals (from shrews and mice to elephants and whales).</p><p>They found that the greater the percentage of insects in an animal\u2019s diet, the more genes for chitinase it has.</p><p>\u201cThe only species that have five chitinases today are highly insectivorous, that is, 80 to 100% of their diet consists of insects,\u201d Dr. Emerling said.</p><p>\u201cSince the earliest placental mammals likely had five chitinases, we think that this makes for a strong argument that they were highly insectivorous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you would expect, ant and termite specialists such as aardvarks and certain armadillos have five functioning chitinase genes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut so do the insect-loving primates called tarsiers. They appear to be the only primates that have so many functional chitinase genes.\u201d</p><p>Among the surprises was that the insect-eating-specialist pangolin has only one functional chitinase gene, in contrast to the five in the aardvark and four in the lesser anteater.</p><p>All eat ants and termites exclusively, but pangolins may have possibly evolved from carnivores that lost their chitinase genes shortly after taking over the ecological niche opened up when meat-eating dinosaurs died out.</p><p>Bison, gibbons and the dromedary camel have only one functional chitinase. Tigers, rhinos and polar bears have none.</p><p>\u201cWe have many other questions we think chitinases can answer about mammal evolution and physiology,\u201d Dr. Emerling said.</p><p>\u201cThis is suggesting that there are a lot of these enzymes that might be helping organisms digest their food. This goes from being a simple curiosity \u2014 humans have a chitinase, how cool! \u2014 to being something that can help us understand how different animals are adapted to their specialized diets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChitinases are found not only in the gut but the salivary glands, the pancreas and the lungs, where they may be involved in asthma,\u201d he said.</p>",

However, little is known about the history of riding donkeys during this early period.</p><p>A bit is often used while riding to allow the rider more control over the animal, as opposed to a tether or nose ring which can simply prevent an animal from wandering, or lead an animal to a new location. Wear and tear on the teeth are often used as a proxy to identify whether or not a bit was worn.</p><p>A research team led by University of Manitoba\u2019s Professor Haskel Greenfield excavated an ancient domestic donkey sealed beneath the courtyard of a house at Tell es-Safi /Gath.</p><p>The scientists used radiocarbon dating to estimate that the domestic donkey was likely buried around 2700 BC.</p><p>Using microscopy, they examined the donkey\u2019s teeth, finding that the tooth enamel had been worn down on the Lower Premolar 2 (LPM2) in an uneven fashion that is indicative of bit wear.</p><p>Normal tooth wear has been identified as more even and polished, yet the beveled surfaces on both of the LPM2 teeth specifically suggest that a bit may have been worn to control the donkey.</p><p>The findings, published in the journal PLoS ONE, suggest that donkeys may have worn bits in the ancient Near East as early as the 3rd millennium, long before the arrival of the horse.</p><p>\u201cThis is significant because it demonstrates how early domestic donkeys were controlled, and adds substantially to our knowledge of the history of donkey domestication and evolution of riding and equestrian technology,\u201d Professor Greenfield said.</p><p>\u201cIt is also significant that it was discovered on the remains of an early domestic donkey that was sacrificed probably as an offering to protect what we interpret to be a merchant domestic residence uncovered during our excavations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe use of a bridle bit on a donkey during this period is surprising, since it was commonly assumed that donkeys were controlled with nose rings, as depicted in Mesopotamian art,\u201d added co-author Professor Aren Maeir, of Bar-Ilan University.</p><p>The team proposes that the wear on the tooth of the donkey was made with a soft bit, likely made from rope or wood.</p><p>\u201cOnly later, from the Middle Bronze Age and onward (after 2000 BC), was it thought that bits, in particular metal bits, were used \u2014 first with horses that were introduced to the Near East at the time, and subsequently with other equids, such as donkeys. Examples of these later bits were found in Israel at Tel Haror,\u201d Professor Maeir said.</p>",

        "text": "<p>A team of neuroscientists from the University of California, San Francisco, and Loma Linda University has identified the first potential treatment for the brain damage caused by exposure to galactic cosmic rays.</p><p>The next era of human exploration will be as challenging as it is exciting. As we seek to explore planets beyond our own, both the distances traversed and the difficulties faced during the voyage will be new to humankind.</p><p>Long space missions, such as the upcoming Mars journey, require a clear understanding of the effects of space exposure on the mental and physical functional capabilities of astronauts.</p><p>The psychological stressors that astronauts face during space travel are powerful and varied, including social isolation, altered sleep patterns, and physical space limitations. This is coupled with the direct impact of the adverse environment of space, which includes exposure to galactic cosmic rays (protons, helium nuclei, and high charge and energy nuclei).</p><p>Astronauts on deep-space missions will be exposed to levels of cosmic radiation estimated to be 1,000 times higher than what we experience on Earth or even in the International Space Station\u2019s orbit.</p><p>University of California, San Francisco Professor Susanna Rosi and co-authors have conducted NASA-funded research for the past four years to understand how cosmic radiation may affect astronauts\u2019 brains.</p><p>The researchers have previously found that exposing mice to simulated cosmic radiation causes problems with memory, social interactions, and anxiety, and has linked these symptoms of radiation exposure to activation of cells called microglia \u2014 part of the brain\u2019s immune system.</p><p>Activated microglia drive brain inflammation similar to what is seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and also seek out and consume synapses, the information-bearing connections between brain cells.</p><p>In the new study, the scientists exposed mice for a day to a dose of radiation comparable to what they might experience in deep space. The experiments were conducted at NASA\u2019s Space Radiation Laboratory.</p><p>A week later, after being shipped back to the team\u2019s lab, some of the mice were treated for 15 days with a drug called PLX5622.</p><p>The irradiated animals initially displayed no cognitive deficits, but after three months they began showing signs of memory impairment.</p><p>Normally, when the researchers place mice in a room with a familiar and an unfamiliar object, the animals spend more time exploring the new object. But mice that had been exposed to space radiation three months earlier explored the two objects equally \u2014 presumably because they didn\u2019t remember having seen one of the objects just the day before.</p><p>Remarkably, the animals that had been treated with PLX5622 soon after being exposed to radiation performed just like healthy mice on the memory task.</p><p>The study authors examined the animals\u2019 brains and showed that while the brains of untreated mice were full of activated microglia and had lost significant numbers of synapses, the brains of treated mice looked just like normal.</p><p>\u201cBy forcing the brain to replace irritable, radiation-exposed microglia with new, healthy microglia, the drug had allowed the animals avoid the cognitive consequences of radiation,\u201d they said.</p><p>\u201cThis is really neat evidence, first that rebooting the brain\u2019s microglia can protect cognitive function following radiation exposure, and second that we don\u2019t necessarily need to treat immediately following the radiation exposure for the drug to be effective,\u201d Professor Rosi said.</p><p>\u201cSimilar compounds to PLX5622 are already in clinical trials for multiple forms of human cancer, which suggests that the new findings could soon be translated to human use,\u201d the scientists said.</p><p>\u201cBeyond spaceflight, these compounds could potentially be used to prevent cognitive impairments following cancer radiation therapy, or in age-related cognitive impairment \u2014 which has also been linked to microglia-driven brain inflammation.\u201d</p><p>The study was published in the May 18 issue of the journal Scientific Reports.</p>",

        "text": "<p>A rare species of orangutan, a majestic tree, a beetle that looks like part of an ant, the world\u2019s deepest-living fish, and the fossil of a marsupial lion that lived in Australia in the Oligocene and Miocene epochs are among the 10 most amazing species chosen by experts at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) from over 18,000 species new to science in 2017.</p><p>ESF releases the top 10 list each year in conjunction with the May 23 birthday of Carolus Linnaeus, an 18th century Swedish botanist who is considered the \u2018Father of Taxonomy.\u2019</p><p>His work in the mid-18th century was the beginning point for \u2018modern\u2019 naming and classification of plants and animals.</p><p>1. The Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis), a species of great ape from the Indonesian island of Sumatra:</p><p>The Tapanuli orangutan is one of three known species of orangutan, alongside the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) and the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus).</p><p>Genomic evidence suggests that while the northern Sumatra and Borneo species separated about 674 thousand years ago, the Tapanuli species diverged much earlier, about 3.38 million years ago.</p><p>Only an estimated 800 individuals of the Tapanuli orangutan exist in fragmented habitat spread over about 250,000 acres (about 1,000 km2) on medium elevation hills and submontane forests from about 1,000 to 4,000 feet (300 to 1,300 m) above sea level, with densest populations in primary forest.</p><p>2. Wakaleo schouteni, a species of carnivorous marsupial lion that lived 26 to 18 million years ago (late Oligocene to early Miocene) in Australia\u2019s rainforests:</p><p>Wakaleo schouteni was the size of a dog and weighed around 23 kg. The species was about a 1/5th of the weight of the largest and last surviving marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, that weighed in at 130 kg and which has been extinct for 30,000 years.</p><p>Its fossilized remains \u2014 a near-complete skull, teeth, and humerus (upper arm bone) \u2014 were found in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area of remote north-western Queensland.</p><p>Wakaleo schouteni spent part of its time in trees. Its teeth suggest that it was not completely reliant on meat but was, rather, an omnivore.</p><p>This predator is part of a lineage \u2014 the genus Wakaleo \u2014 that followed Cope\u2019s rule during the Miocene, increasing in size through time, possibly in response to larger prey that, in turn, evolved as the flora changed as the continent became drier and cooler.</p><p>Based on their discovery, paleontologists believe two species of marsupial lion were present in the late Oligocene 25 million years ago. The other, Wakaleo pitikantensis, was slightly smaller and was identified from teeth and limb bones discovered near Lake Pitikanta in South Australia in 1961.</p><p>3. Dinizia jueirana-facao, a tree species from the semi-deciduous Atlantic rainforest in Esp\u00edrito Santo state, Brazil:</p><p>The legume genus Dinizia was known, until now, from a single Amazonian tree species, Dinizia excelsa, discovered nearly 100 years ago.</p><p>Dinizia jueirana-facao grows up to 130 feet (40 m) in height. Weighing an estimated 56,000 kg, this massive tree is smaller than its Amazonian sister-species and lacks its buttresses, but is similarly impressive.</p><p>While large in dimension, the tree is limited in numbers \u2014 it is known from only 25 individuals, about half of which are in the protected area, making it critically endangered.</p><p>4. The Mariana snailfish (Pseudoliparis swirei), the world\u2019s deepest-living fish:</p><p>The Mariana snailfish is a small, tadpole-like fish measuring a little over 4 inches (11.2 cm) in length yet appears to be the top predator in its benthic community.</p><p>It lives at 26,200 feet (8,000 m) below the surface and is endemic to the Mariana Trench, the deepest stretch of ocean in the world that is located in the western Pacific Ocean.</p><p>A fish was recorded on camera at an even greater depth, at nearly 27,000 feet (8,143 m) but it was not recovered and could not be confirmed to be the same species.</p><p>5. Nymphister kronaueri, an army ant-associated beetle species from Costa Rica:</p><p>At about 1.5 mm in length, 16 individuals of Nymphister kronaueri could line up head-to-tail in the space of an inch (2.5 cm).</p><p>But their story gets much better. They live exclusively among one species of army ant, Eciton mexicanum.</p><p>The host ants, as with other army ants, do not construct permanent nests but are nomadic. In the case of Eciton mexicanum, they spend two to three weeks on the move, making raids each day to capture thousands of prey items, then spend two to three weeks in one location.</p><p>While the beetle can move about and feed while the host colony is stationary, it must make the trip with the ants when they are on the move to a new location. The beetle\u2019s body is the precise size, shape and color of the abdomen of a worker ant.</p><p>Nymphister kronaueri uses its mouthparts to grab the skinny portion of the host abdomen and hang on, letting the ant do the walking. At a glance, an ant with the beetle onboard appears to have two abdomens but the upper one is a beetle.</p><p>Like other myrmecophiles (literally, ant lovers), these beetles must use chemical signals or other adaptations to avoid becoming prey themselves.</p><p>6. Ancoracysta twista, a single-celled predatory protist:</p><p>Ancoracysta twista is a predatory flagellate that uses its whip-like flagella to propel itself and unusual harpoon-like organelles, called ancoracysts, to immobilize other protists on which it feeds.</p><p>It was discovered in a tropical aquarium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California. The geographic origin of the species in the wild is not known.</p><p>Ancoracysta twista has challenged scientists to determine its nearest relatives. It does not fit neatly within any known group and appears to be a previously undiscovered, early lineage of eukaryota with a uniquely rich mitochondrial genome.</p><p>7. Epimeria quasimodo, a species of amphipod from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic seas:</p><p>Epimeria quasimodo, about 2 inches (5 cm) in length, is named for Victor Hugo\u2019s character, Quasimodo the hunchback, in reference to its somewhat humped back.</p><p>It is one of 26 new species of amphipods of the genus Epimeria from the Southern Ocean with incredible spines and vivid colors.</p><p>The number of species, and their extraordinary morphological structures and colors, makes this genus an icon of the Southern Ocean that includes both free-swimming predators and sessile filter feeders.</p><p>8. Sciaphila sugimotoi, a mycoheterotrophic plant species from Ishigaki Island, Japan:</p><p>Most plants are autotrophic, capturing solar energy to feed themselves by means of photosynthesis. A few, like the newly-discovered Sciaphila sugimotoi, are heterotrophic, deriving their sustenance from other organisms.</p><p>In this case, the plant is symbiotic with a fungus from which it derives nutrition without harm to the partner.</p><p>In fact, the plant family Triuridaceae to which it belongs consists entirely of such mycoheterotrophs (fungus symbionts).</p><p>The discovery of any new species of plant in Japan is newsworthy as the flora is well-documented, so such a beautiful new flower is an exciting addition.</p><p>The delicate Sciaphila sugimotoi, just under 4 inches (10 cm) in height, appears during short flowering times in September and October, producing small blossoms.</p><p>9. Thiolava veneris, a species of bacterium from the Canary Islands:</p><p>When the submarine volcano Tagoro erupted off the coast of El Hierro in the Canary Islands in 2011, it abruptly increased water temperature, decreased oxygen and released massive quantities of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, wiping out much of the existing marine ecosystem.</p><p>Three years later, scientists found the first colonizers of this newly deposited area \u2014 Thiolava veneris, a species of proteobacterium producing long, hair-like structures composed of bacterial cells within a sheath.</p><p>Thiolava veneris formed a massive white mat, extending for nearly half an acre (about 2,000 m2) around the summit of the newly formed Tagoro volcanic cone at depths of about 430 feet (129-132 m).</p><p>The researchers concluded that the unique metabolic characteristics of the bacteria allow them to colonize this newly-formed seabed, paving the way for development of early-stage ecosystems.</p><p>They dubbed the filamentous mat of bacteria \u2018Venus\u2019 hair.\u2019</p><p>10. Xuedytes bellus, a species of cave-specialized beetle from southern China:</p><p>Beetles that become adapted to life in the permanent darkness of caves often resemble one another in a whole suite of characteristics including a compact body, greatly elongated, spider-like appendages, and loss of flight wings, eyes and pigmentation.</p><p>Such troglobitic beetles are a prime example of convergent evolution, that is, unrelated species evolving similar attributes as adaptions to similar selection forces.</p><p>Xuedytes bellus, a species of troglobitic ground beetle from China, less than half an inch in length (about 9 mm), is striking in the dramatic elongation of its head and prothorax, the body segment immediately behind the head to which the first pair of legs attach.</p>",

The intense regions of radiation being observed are associated with the beams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brown dwarf companion is about a third the diameter of the Sun and is roughly 1.2 million miles (2 million km) from the pulsar. It is tidally locked to the pulsar so that one side always faces its pulsating companion, the way the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it is so close to the pulsar, the brown dwarf is blasted by the strong radiation coming from its smaller companion. The intense radiation from the pulsar heats one side of the relatively cool dwarf star to the temperature of our Sun, or some 10,800 degrees Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius).\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blast from the pulsar could ultimately spell its companion\u2019s demise. Pulsars in these types of binary systems are called \u2018black widow\u2019 pulsars. Just as a black widow spider eats its mate, it is thought that the pulsar, given the right conditions, could gradually erode gas from the dwarf star until the latter is consumed.\u201d</p><p>The gas is acting as like a magnifying glass right in front of the pulsar, the team found.</p><p>\u201cWe are essentially looking at the pulsar through a naturally occurring magnifier which periodically allows us to see the two regions separately,\u201d Main said.</p><p>In addition to being an observation of incredibly high resolution, the team\u2019s result could be a clue to the nature of mysterious phenomena known as\u00a0fast radio bursts (FRBs).</p><p>\u201cMany observed properties of FRBs could be explained if they are being amplified by plasma lenses,\u201d Main said.</p><p>\u201cThe properties of the amplified pulses we detected in our study show a remarkable similarity to the bursts from the repeating FRB, suggesting that the repeating FRB may be lensed by plasma in its host galaxy.\u201d</p>",

        "text": "<p>A group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has developed an injectable nanoparticle formulation of the inactivated polio vaccine that releases multiple pulses of stable antigen over time. This new vaccine could make it easier to immunize children in remote regions of Pakistan and other countries where polio is still found.</p><p>There are no drugs against poliovirus, and in about 1% of cases, it enters the nervous system, where it can cause paralysis.</p><p>The first polio vaccine, also called the Salk vaccine, was developed in the 1950s. This vaccine consists of an inactivated version of the virus, which is usually given as a series of two to four injections, beginning at 2 months of age.</p><p>In 1961, an oral vaccine was developed, which offers some protection with only one dose but is more effective with two to three doses.</p><p>The oral vaccine, which consists of a virus that has reduced virulence but is still viable, has been phased out in most countries because in very rare cases, it can mutate to a virulent form and cause infection. It is still used in some developing countries, however, because it is easier to administer the drops than to reach children for multiple injections of the Salk vaccine.</p><p>For polio eradication efforts to succeed, the oral vaccine must be completely phased out, to eliminate the chance of the virus reactivating in an immunized person.</p><p>Several years ago, MIT Professor Robert Langer and colleagues set out to develop an injectable vaccine that could be given just once but carry multiple doses.</p><p>\u201cThe goal is to ensure that everyone globally is immunized. Children in some of these hard-to-reach developing world locations tend to not get the full series of shots necessary for protection,\u201d said team member Dr. Ana Jaklenec, a scientist at MIT\u2019s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.</p><p>To create a single-injection vaccine, the researchers encapsulated the inactivated polio vaccine in a biodegradable polymer known as PLGA. This polymer can be designed to degrade after a certain period of time, allowing the scientists to control when the vaccine is released.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a little bit of vaccine that\u2019s left on the surface or very close to the surface of the particle, and as soon as we put it in the body, whatever is at the surface can just diffuse away. That\u2019s the initial burst,\u201d said team member Dr. Stephany Tzeng, a former MIT postdoc who is now a research associate at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p><p>\u201cThen the particles sit at the injection site and over time, as the polymer degrades, they release the vaccine in bursts at defined time points, based on the degradation rate of the polymer.\u201d</p><p>In the new study, the team designed particles that would deliver an initial burst at the time of injection, followed by a second release about 25 days later.</p><p>The researchers injected the particles into rats, then sent blood samples from the immunized rats to the Centers for Disease Control for testing.</p><p>Those studies revealed that the blood samples from rats immunized with the single-injection particle vaccine had an antibody response against poliovirus just as strong as, or stronger than, antibodies from rats that received two injections of Salk polio vaccine.</p><p>\u201cTo deliver more than two doses, we could design particles that release vaccine at injection and one month later, and mix them with particles that release at injection and two months later, resulting in three overall doses, each a month apart,\u201d the scientists said.</p><p>\u201cThe polymers that we used in the vaccines are already FDA-approved for use in humans, so we hope to soon be able to test the vaccines in clinical trials.\u201d</p><p>The study was published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>",

        "text": "<p>A team of paleontologists has discovered and described the nearly complete fossilized skull of a previously unknown mammal relative that lived about 130 million years ago (Early Cretaceous epoch). The study appears in the journal Nature.</p><p>The 130-million-year-old fossil skull was found at the Cedar Mountain Formation, a rock formation in Utah dated to between 139 million and 124 million years ago.</p><p>It was analyzed by a group of experts from the University of Chicago, the Natural History Museum of Utah, the Utah Geological Survey, and the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.</p><p>The researchers used an imaging technique called micro-computed tomography to reveal anatomical details about the skull.</p><p>\u201cWith an estimated body weight of up to 2.5 pounds (0.9 kg), the ancient creature \u2014 named Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch \u2014 would seem small compared to many living mammals, but it was a giant among its Cretaceous contemporaries,\u201d they said.</p><p>\u201cA full-grown Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch was probably about the size of a small hare or pika (small mammal with rounded ears, short limbs and a very small tail).\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had teeth similar to fruit-eating bats and could nip, shear and crush. It might have incorporated plants into its diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe animal had a relatively small brain and giant \u2018olfactory bulbs\u2019 to process sense of smell. The skull had tiny eye sockets, so the animal probably did not have good eyesight or color vision. It possibly was nocturnal and depended on sense of smell to root out food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a long time, we thought early mammals from the Cretaceous were anatomically similar and not ecologically diverse,\u201d said study lead author Dr. Adam Huttenlocker, from the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.</p><p>\u201cThis finding by our team and others reinforce that, even before the rise of modern mammals, ancient relatives of mammals were exploring specialty niches: insectivores, herbivores, carnivores, swimmers, gliders. Basically, they were occupying a variety of niches that we see them occupy today.\u201d</p><p>The scientists also found that Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch belonged to a long-lived and widespread group of early mammal relatives called Haramiyida. These early mammal relatives included the closest relatives of the common ancestor of all true living mammals.</p><p>The fossil was the first of its particular subgroup \u2014 Hahnodontidae \u2014 found in North America. This subgroup was previously known only from the Cretaceous of Northern Africa.</p><p>\u201cBased on the unlikely discovery of this near-complete fossil cranium, we now recognize a new, cosmopolitan group of early mammal relatives,\u201d Dr. Huttenlocker said.</p><p>The fossil discovery emphasizes that haramiyidans and some other vertebrate groups existed globally during the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition.</p><p>It suggests that the divide of the ancient landmass Pangaea continued for about 15 million years later than previously thought and that mammal migration and that of their close relatives continued during the Early Cretaceous (145 to 101 million years ago).</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s generally thought that the northern and southern continents, as well as Europe and North America, were completely separated by the end of the Jurassic period (about 145 million years ago),\u201d Dr. Huttenlocker said.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that the earliest Cretaceous record is not as well studied in North America or in Africa, making it difficult to compare continental vertebrate assemblages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBased on intense fieldwork taking place now in the basal Cretaceous of Utah and in Europe, there is evidence of a \u2018North Atlantic Land Bridge\u2019 that may have connected the Old and New Worlds into the Cretaceous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShared dinosaur groups found in Africa and Europe further present the possibility that similar connections existed between the southern and northern continents, transforming our understanding of the timing and order of the Pangaean supercontinent\u2019s breakup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe study reveals that the early mammal precursors migrated from Asia to Europe, into North America and further onto major Southern continents,\u201d added senor author Professor Zhe-Xi Luo, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Ground-dwelling birds survived while their close, tree-dwelling relatives went extinct during the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event, caused by the impact of an asteroid off the Mexican coast some 66 million years ago, according to new research.</p><p>An international research team led by Dr. Daniel Field of the University of Bath pieced together evidence from the plant fossil record and ecology of ancient and modern birds, and found that the only birds to survive the end-Cretaceous extinction (also known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene, Cretaceous-Tertiary or K-Pg extinction) lived on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWe drew on a variety of approaches to stitch this story together. We concluded that the temporary elimination of forests in the aftermath of the asteroid impact explains why arboreal birds failed to survive across this extinction event,\u201d Dr. Field said.</p><p>\u201cThe ancestors of modern arboreal birds did not move into the trees until forests had recovered from the extinction-causing asteroid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking at the fossil record, at plants and birds, there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the forest canopies collapsed. Perching birds went extinct because there were no more perches,\u201d added co-author Dr. Regan Dunn, a paleontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.</p><p>\u201cThis study provides a large-picture, ecosystem-wide explanation for why certain groups did well after the extinction and set the stage for modern birds,\u201d said co-author Dr. Tyler Lyson, a paleontologist at Denver Museum of Nature & Science.</p><p>\u201cIt is fascinating to me that an event that happened 66.02 million years ago shaped the modern world, and we\u2019re able to see this through molecular data thanks to technology that wasn\u2019t even around 10 years ago.\u201d</p><p>The team\u2019s analysis of the plant fossil record confirmed that global forests collapsed in the wake of the asteroid\u2019s impact.</p><p>\u201cOur study examined the fossil record from New Zealand, Japan, Europe and North America which showed there was a mass deforestation across the globe at the end-Cretaceous boundary,\u201d explained co-author Dr. Antoine Bercovici, a paleobotanist at Smithsonian Institution.</p><p>\u201cThis was followed by a mass colonization of so-called \u2018disaster plants,\u2019 such as ferns, whose spores were able to survive the asteroid hit and germinate rapidly to fill the habitats left empty by the extinction of the trees.\u201d</p><p>The scientists then used the evolutionary relationships of living birds and their ecological habits to track how bird ecology has changed over the course of their evolutionary history.</p><p>Those analyses showed that the most recent common ancestor of all living birds \u2014 and all bird lineages passing through the end-Cretaceous extinction event \u2014 likely lived on the ground.</p><p>By contrast, many birds that lived at the end of the age of dinosaurs exhibited tree-dwelling habits. However, those species didn\u2019t survive the extinction event to give rise to any known modern-day birds.</p><p>The ancestors of modern tree-dwelling birds did not move into the trees until forests had recovered from the extinction-causing asteroid.</p><p>\u201cToday, birds are the most diverse and globally widespread group of terrestrial vertebrate animals \u2014 there are nearly 11,000 living species,\u201d Dr. Field said.</p><p>\u201cOnly a handful of ancestral bird lineages succeeded in surviving the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, and all of today\u2019s amazing living bird diversity can be traced to these ancient survivors.\u201d</p><p>The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, illustrate the fundamental influence of major events in Earth\u2019s history on the evolutionary trajectories of major groups of organisms.</p><p>In the future, the research team plans to continue to explore the precise timing of forest recovery and the early evolutionary radiation of birds.</p>",

        "slug": "newly-identified-human-specific-genes-influence-brain-size",
        "text": "<p>A set of three nearly identical genes found only in humans, NOTCH2NL, appears to play a critical role in the development of our large brains, according to a pair of studies published this week in the journal Cell. The NOTCH2NL genes are found exclusively in humans and appeared between 3 and 4 million years ago, just before the period when fossils show a dramatic increase in the brain sizes of human ancestors. These genes belong to an ancient family of genes known as NOTCH genes, first discovered in fruit flies and named for a genetic defect causing notched wings.</p><p>The evolution of larger brains in the last 3 million years played an important role in our ability as a species to think, problem-solve, and develop culture. But the genetic changes behind the expansion that made us human have been elusive.</p><p>\u201cOur brains got three times as big primarily through the expansion of certain functional areas of the cerebral cortex, and that has to be a fundamental substrate for us becoming human,\u201d said Dr. David Haussler, co-lead author of one of the Cell papers and a researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really no more exciting scientific question that I can think of than discovering and decoding the mysterious genetic changes that made us who we are.\u201d</p><p>The newly-identified human-specific genes were derived from NOTCH2, one of four mammalian NOTCH genes, through a duplication event that inserted an extra partial copy of NOTCH2 into the genome.</p><p>This happened in an ancient ape species that was a common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. The partial duplicate was a nonfunctional \u2018pseudogene,\u2019 versions of which are still found in chimp and gorilla genomes.</p><p>In the human lineage, however, this pseudogene was \u2018revived\u2019 when additional NOTCH2 DNA was copied into its place, creating a functional gene. This new gene was then duplicated several more times, resulting in four related NOTCH2NL genes.</p><p>One of the four NOTCH2NL genes appears to be a nonfunctional pseudogene, but the other three (NOTCH2NLA, NOTCH2NLB, and NOTCH2NLC) are active genes that direct the production of truncated versions of the original NOTCH2 protein.</p><p>\u201cWe were comparing genes expressed during brain development in humans and macaque monkeys in stem cell-derived models when we realized that we could detect NOTCH2NL in human cells but not in those of the macaques,\u201d the researchers explained.</p><p>\u201cLooking at the DNA, we also didn\u2019t see it in orangutans and found only truncated, inactive versions in our closest relatives, gorillas and chimpanzees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReconstructing the evolutionary history of NOTCH2NL genes revealed that a process called gene conversion was likely responsible for repairing a non-functional version of NOTCH2NL, which originally emerged as a partial duplication of an essential neurodevelopmental gene known as NOTCH2.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis repair happened only in humans \u2014 and we estimate it happened 3-4 million years ago, around the same time that the fossil record suggests human brains began to expand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter it was repaired, but before we diverged from our common ancestor with Neanderthals, NOTCH2NL was duplicated two more times.\u201d</p><p>The team behind the other Cell paper, led by developmental biologist Pierre Vanderhaeghen of Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles and VIB-KU Leuven, arrived at NOTCH2NL from a related direction, searching for human-specific genes active during fetal brain development using primary tissue.</p><p>\u201cOne of the holy grails of researchers like us is to find out what during human development and evolution is responsible for a bigger brain, particularly the cerebral cortex. Given the relatively fast evolution of the human brain, it is tempting to speculate that newly evolved, human-specific genes may help shape our brain in a species-specific way,\u201d Dr. Vanderhaeghen said.</p><p>Searching for human-specific genes involved in brain development proved challenging because these genes are typically poorly annotated in genome databases and hard to distinguish from more common genes present in other species.</p><p>Dr. Vanderhaeghen\u2019s team developed a tailored RNA sequencing analysis for specific and sensitive detection of human-specific genes in human fetal cerebral cortex.</p><p>This allowed the study authors to identify a repertoire of 35 genes unique to humans that are active during development of the cerebral cortex in humans, including NOTCH2NL genes.</p><p>They zeroed in on NOTCH2NL in particular because of the importance of its ancestral gene, NOTCH2, in signaling processes that control whether cortical stem cells produce neurons or regenerate more stem cells. And they found that artificially expressing NOTCH2NL in mouse embryos increased the number of progenitor stem cells in the mouse cortex.</p><p>To better understand what the genes do in humans, the scientists turned to an in vitro model of cortical development from human pluripotent stem cells to explore NOTCH2NL function.</p><p>In this model, they found that NOTCH2NL can substantially expand the population of cortical stem cells, which in turn then generate more neurons, a feature expected to distinguish between human and non-human cortical neurogenesis.</p><p>\u201cFrom one stem cell, you can either regenerate two progenitor cells, generate two neurons, or generate one progenitor stem cell and one neuron,\u201d Dr. Vanderhaeghen said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what NOTCH2NL does is bias that decision in a slight way towards regenerating progenitors, which can later go on to make more neurons. It\u2019s a small early effect with large late consequences, as often happens with evolution.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Haussler and colleagues looked at what happened when NOTCH2NL wasn\u2019t expressed: they deleted it from human stem cells and used them to grow patches of cortex called organoids.</p><p>In the organoids derived from NOTCH2NL-depleted stem cells, differentiation occurred faster, but the organoids ended up being smaller.</p><p>\u201cIf you lose NOTCH2NL, it leads to premature differentiation of cortical stem cells into neurons, but at the same time the very important stem cell pool gets depleted,\u201d said University of Amsterdam researcher Dr. Frank Jacobs, a member of Dr. Haussler\u2019s team.</p><p>NOTCH2NL\u2019s location on the genome, incorrectly mapped until recently, is further support for its role in human brain size.</p><p>Duplications or deletions at a genome region known as 1q21.1 are known to cause macrocephaly or microcephaly, respectively, and are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability.</p><p>Dr. Haussler\u2019s team looked at 11 patients with errors at this locus and found that NOTCH2NL was indeed being duplicated and deleted in the rearrangement events associated with larger and smaller brain size that resulted.</p><p>\u201cWe really wanted the gene to be in the 1q21.1 disease interval, because it made logical sense, but in the incorrect reference genome, it wasn\u2019t. And then we found new data, and we realized that it was a mistake in the reference genome! It seldom happens that when you want something that appears to be false to be true, it turns out to actually be true. I don\u2019t think something of that level will ever happen again in my career,\u201d Dr. Haussler said.</p><p>Because NOTCH2NL is something of an evolutionary trade-off between larger brains and 1q21.1 disease susceptibility, the researchers are all quick to point out that there is plenty of healthy variation here, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boon that may have enabled us to get a big brain. And yes, it\u2019s a bane, because we can have these recombination events that can be bad. But what we found when we developed the technology to really sequence it in individuals is that there are multiple different alleles of this gene. And it\u2019s possible that that variation creates the subtlety and plasticity that is important in enabling humans to be human,\u201d said Dr. Sofie Salama, a researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and a member of Dr. Haussler\u2019s team.</p><p>_____</p>",

        "text": "<p>Wind-blown dunes are known on Earth, Mars, Venus, Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, and Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \u2014 and, now on Pluto, according to a team of planetary researchers led by a University of Plymouth scientist.</p><p>The researchers analyzed detailed images of one of Pluto\u2019s largest features, a vast ice plain called Sputnik Planitia, captured in July 2015 by NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft.</p><p>Those images showed that on the boundary of the region, and pushed up against a major mountain range, there is a series of dunes spread across an area less than 47 miles (75 km) across.</p><p>Pluto\u2019s dunes are unlike the dunes made of sand seen on Earth though; instead, they are likely made of tiny grains of methane ice.</p><p>Modeling by the team shows that Pluto\u2019s moderate winds (which can reach between 19 and 25 mph, or 30-40 kmh) can create these dunes once the grains are airborne.</p><p>However, a process called sublimation is required first, to lift the grains from the planet\u2019s surface. In this process, the Sun heats surface ice enough that gas is released into the atmosphere, lofting particles into the air as a result.</p><p>The likely source of the dune grains is methane ice blown from nearby mountains, although nitrogen ice cannot be ruled out, as a source.</p><p>The scientists also believe the undisturbed morphology of the dunes and their relationship with the underlying glacial ice suggests the features are likely to have been formed within the last 500,000 years, and possibly much more recently.</p><p>\u201cWe knew that every solar system body with an atmosphere and a solid rocky surface has dunes on it, but we didn\u2019t know what we\u2019d find on Pluto,\u201d said lead author Dr. Matt Telfer, from the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Plymouth.</p><p>\u201cIt turns out that even though there is so little atmosphere, and the surface temperature is around minus 382 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 230 degrees Celsius), we still get dunes forming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe New Horizons data has given us a new level of detail, but we had to work hard to explain how it was possible to get the supply of sediment, a non-cohesive surface and wind you need for dunes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is another piece of the jigsaw in making sense of this diverse and remote body, and gives us a more fundamental understanding of the geological processes which are influencing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Earth, you need a certain strength of wind to release sand particles into the air, but winds that are 20% weaker are then sufficient to maintain transport,\u201d said co-author Dr. Eric Parteli, from the Department of Geosciences at the University of Cologne.</p><p>\u201cThe considerably lower gravity of Pluto, and the extremely low atmospheric pressure, means the winds needed to maintain sediment transport can be a hundred times lower. The temperature gradients in the granular ice layer, caused by solar radiation, also play an important role in the onset of the saltation process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut together, we have found that these combined processes can form dunes under normal, everyday wind conditions on Pluto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we first saw the New Horizons images, we thought instantly that these were dunes but it was really surprising because we know there is not much of an atmosphere,\u201d said co-author Dr. Jani Radebaugh, from the Department of Geological Sciences, College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at Brigham Young University.</p><p>\u201cHowever despite being 30 times further away from the Sun as the Earth, it turns out Pluto still has Earth-like characteristics. We have been focusing on what\u2019s close to us, but there\u2019s a wealth of information in the distant reaches of the Solar System too.\u201d</p><p>The findings appear in the journal Science.</p>",

        "slug": "does-small-fraction-of-dark-matter-particles-carry-electric-mini-charge",
        "text": "<p>A duo of astrophysicists is proposing a new model for the invisible material that makes up most of the Universe: it\u2019s possible that a small fraction (less than 1%) of dark matter particles may have a tiny electrical charge \u2014 a million times smaller than the charge on the electron.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of electric cars and e-books, but now we are talking about electric dark matter. However, this electric charge is on the very smallest of scales,\u201d said lead author Dr. Julian Munoz, of Harvard University.</p><p>Dr. Munoz and his co-author, Professor Avi Loeb of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, explore the possibility that charged dark matter particles interact with normal matter by the electromagnetic force.</p><p>Their work, published in the journal Nature, dovetails with recently results from the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) Collaboration.</p><p>Earlier this year, EDGES scientists said they had detected the radio signature from the first generation of stars, and possible evidence for interaction between dark matter and normal matter.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Munoz and Professor Loeb were already looking at the theoretical basis underlying it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re able to tell a fundamental physics story with our research no matter how you interpret the EDGES result. The nature of dark matter is one of the biggest mysteries in science and we need to use any related new data to tackle it,\u201d Professor Loeb said.</p><p>The story begins with the first stars, which emitted UV light.</p><p>According to the commonly accepted scenario, this UV light interacted with cold hydrogen atoms in gas lying between the stars and enabled them to absorb the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, the leftover radiation from the Big Bang.</p><p>This absorption should have led to a drop in intensity of the CMB during this period, which occurs less than 200 million years after the Big Bang.</p><p>The EDGES team claimed to detect evidence for this absorption of CMB light, though this has yet to be independently verified by other scientists. However, the temperature of the hydrogen gas in the EDGES data is about half of the expected value.</p><p>\u201cIf EDGES has detected cooler than expected hydrogen gas during this period, what could explain it? One possibility is that hydrogen was cooled by the dark matter,\u201d Dr. Munoz said.</p><p>At the time when CMB radiation is being absorbed, the any free electrons or protons associated with ordinary matter would have been moving at their slowest possible speeds (since later on they were heated by X-rays from the first black holes).</p><p>Scattering of charged particles is most effective at low speeds. Therefore, any interactions between normal matter and dark matter during this time would have been the strongest if some of the dark matter particles are charged.</p><p>This interaction would cause the hydrogen gas to cool because the dark matter is cold, potentially leaving an observational signature like that claimed by the EDGES project.</p><p>\u201cWe are constraining the possibility that dark matter particles carry a tiny electrical charge \u2014 equal to one millionth that of an electron \u2014 through measurable signals from the cosmic dawn. Such tiny charges are impossible to observe even with the largest particle accelerators,\u201d Professor Loeb said.</p><p>Only small amounts of dark matter with weak electrical charge can both explain the EDGES data and avoid disagreement with other observations.</p><p>If most of the dark matter is charged, then these particles would have been deflected away from regions close to the disk of our Mily Way Galaxy, and prevented from reentering. This conflicts with observations showing that large amounts of dark matter are located close to the disk of the Milky Way.</p><p>Astrophysicists know from observations of the CMB that protons and electrons combined in the early Universe to form neutral atoms.</p><p>Only a small fraction of these charged particles, about one in a few thousand, remained free.</p><p>Dr. Munoz and Professor Loeb are considering the possibility that dark matter may have acted in a similar way.</p><p>The data from EDGES, and similar experiments, might be the only way to detect the few remaining charged particles, as most of the dark matter would be neutral.</p>",

The results appear in the Journal of Translational Medicine.</p><p>Personalized vaccines are specifically tailored to individual patients.</p><p>The clinical trial included 331 patients (18\u201370 years of age and had newly diagnosed glioblastoma) and was conducted at over 80 sites in 4 countries: the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK.</p><p>The patients were randomized to receive standard therapy plus the personalized vaccine DCVax-L or standard therapy plus a placebo.</p><p>The trial was funded by the vaccine maker, Northwest Biotherapeutics Inc.</p><p>According to the trial design, the vaccine group had twice the number of patients as the placebo group.</p><p>Further, any patient in the trial was allowed to receive the vaccine if his or her cancer recurred or progressed after initial treatment.</p><p>As such, almost 90% of all participants received the investigational vaccine.</p><p>\u201cDCVax-L was specific to each patient,\u201d the study authors said.</p><p>\u201cAfter surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, a small amount of tumor tissue is processed and then exposed to the same patient\u2019s own immune cells, called dendritic cells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExposure to the tumor material essentially trains the dendritic cells to seek out and destroy tumor cells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese trained dendritic cells are returned to the patient as a vaccine injected in the arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelatively few vaccinations are needed: the first three are weeks apart; the next three are months apart; and then they continue with one vaccination every six months after the first year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vaccine had very few side effects, especially compared with standard treatment for this cancer, which includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy,\u201d said co-author Dr. Jian L. Campian, of Washington University and Siteman Cancer Center.</p><p>\u201cAbout 2% of participants (seven patients) experienced a serious adverse event \u2014 such as brain swelling or seizures \u2014 that may have been related to the vaccine.\u201d</p><p>The trial is ongoing to allow for continued study of patients who are living beyond what is expected of those diagnosed with glioblastoma.</p><p>As of the analysis detailed in the study, all 331 patients in the trial (including those who did and did not receive the vaccine) had a median survival of just over 23 months.</p><p>One-hundred patients had an average overall survival of 40.5 months \u2014 more than three years \u2014 and were designated as \u2018extended survivors.\u2019</p><p>Investigators are particularly interested in the latter group\u2019s response to the vaccine, though they don\u2019t yet know whether everyone in this group received the vaccine since the trial is ongoing and remains blinded.</p><p>The continued blinding means neither the patients nor physicians know which patients are receiving the vaccine.</p><p>But since the researchers reported that almost 90% of all participants received the vaccine at some point, the chances that the extended survivors are getting the vaccine, rather than placebo, are high.</p><p>\u201cThe overall patient population in the trial appears to live longer than we would typically see with current standard of care, and 30% of the patients have lived much longer than we would expect, given the typical course of this cancer,\u201d Dr. Campian said.</p><p>\u201cIn general, patients with this cancer live 15 to 17 months. The surprising part was that the 100 \u2018extended survivors\u2019 don\u2019t appear to have the usual characteristics associated with a good prognosis. We are continuing to study these patients to understand why they have done so well.\u201d</p>",
